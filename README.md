# Project Plan

## Purpose
This project will examine the weather data from 2022 along with my fitbit activity.

## Features

### Feature 1
Read TWO data files (JSON, CSV, Excel, etc.). 

### Feature 2
Clean your data and perform a pandas merge with your two data sets, then calculate some new values based on the new data set.

### Feature 3
Make a Tableau dashboard to display your data

### Feature 4
Utilize a virtual environment and include instructions in your README on how the user should set one up

### Feature 5
Annotate your code with markdown cells in Jupyter Notebook, write clear code comments, and have a well-written README.md. Tidy up your notebook, and make sure you don’t have any empty cells or incomplete cells that don’t do anything. Make sure it’s all functional before your final github commit.
